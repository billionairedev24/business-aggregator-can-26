- 2026-09-08 · Enums stored as `text + CHECK` in V0xx; promote to native enums after schema stabilises · keeps early migrations cheap · DATA_MODEL.md
- 2026-09-08 · Cross-module references are logical (no FK) to preserve module extractability · ARCHITECTURE.md (Spring Modulith)


## 2026-09-27 — v2 redesign + stack change
- Visual system replaced: Broadsheet → Northline "Spruce & Honey" (design/theme/northline.css, web/packages/tokens).
- Java 25 + Spring Boot 4.1.1 replaces Java 21 / Boot 3. Go services dropped — tracking runs in Java (SSE + Redis pub/sub) on virtual threads.
- Keycloak → Spring Authorization Server (we own the login UX, passkeys, "Not you?").
- OpenSearch → Elasticsearch 9. Debezium removed — Spring Modulith event publication registry is the outbox and externalizes to Kafka.
- Starter artifact names follow Boot 4's modular starters. Verify exact names/versions on start.spring.io at implementation time and record changes here.
- Orders moved from top nav to account menu; location auto-detected (browser geolocation → /api/v1/geo/reverse) with saved-address fallback; Shop/Services/Food are landing pages.
